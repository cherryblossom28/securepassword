# securepassword
proposed a password protection scheme called ENP, and presented a password authentication framework based on the ENP. 
In our framework, the entries in the authentication data table are ENPs. In the end, we analyzed and compared the attack complexity of hashed password, salted password, key stretching and the ENP. The results show that the ENP could resist lookup table attack and provide stronger password protection under dictionary attack. It is worth mentioning that the ENP does not need extra elements (e.g., salt) while resisting lookup table attack. In the future, other NDB generation algorithms will be studied and introduced to the ENP to further improve password security.
Furthermore, other techniques, such as multi–factor authentication and challenge–response authentication, will be introduced into our password authentication framework.
